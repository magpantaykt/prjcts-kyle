Name: Kyle Trisha G. Magpantay

Motivation: I am taking the first steps of my career and I'm making sure that I'll make it until the very end. I actually don't know what to add more. I cannot think of anything else to add but I just want to add a few more words so I can justify that this is a paragraph. 

High School Experience: I'm actually a journalist and a feature editor for our school publication back in high school. Unsurprisingly, I took STEM in SHS and Computer Engineering in college. Unsurprisingly because journalism wasn't really my passion and I joined because of extracurricular points.
